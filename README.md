# pratt_2016_cultural_heritage

This is my final project for Programming for Cultural Heritage at Pratt Institute. I used python to query the internal API at the New York Times. This API is only available to employees. I was able to query the API for all articles tagged "ghosts" or "haunted houses" from 1851-1935. I then bounded the results I wanted to achieve by date and added in and additional query to get a couple of articles by headline, since I knew they were about ghosts, but weren't coming up because of bad tagging. I looped through all the results and then exported them to JSON.
